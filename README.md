# Traffic

Developing a neural net to identify traffic signs from a photogrpah.


## Experimentation Process

I started with a simple convolutional neural network model based on the lecture source code, with the following structure:
- 1 convolutional layer, learning 32 filters using a 3x3 kernel
- 1 max-pooling layer, using a 2x2 pool size
- 1 hidden layer with 128 nodes
- 0.5 dropout rate
- output layer with output units for all traffic sign categories

I then tested different modifications to the base model, with the goal of finding a model with the best testing accuracy.

| 1  | Base model                                                                                   | `0.0544`             |
| 2  | Add second convolutional layer, identical to the first                                       | `0.9708`             |
| 3  | Add second maxpooling layer (after the second convolutional layer), identical to the first   | `0.9503`             |
| 4  | Remove second maxpooling layer, increase kernal size in second convolutional layer to (4, 4) | `0.9480`             |
| 5  | Double number of filters (to 64) in second convolutional layer                               | `0.9684`             |
| 6  | Double number of nodes in hidden layer to 256                                                | `0.9528`             |
| 7  | Add second hidden layer (both layers with 128 nodes)                                         | `0.9511`             |
| 8  | Remove dropout                                                                               | `0.9486`             |
| 9  | Increase dropout rate to 0.7                                                                 | `0.9022`             |
| 10 | Decrease dropout rate to 0.2                                                                 | `0.9491`             |


## Discussion

The base model performed very poorly, with only `0.0544` testing accuracy. Adding a second convolutional layer dramatically improved accuracy to `0.9708`. None of the other tested models were able to top this accuracy score. However, adding a second max-pooling layer,  doubling the number of filters in the second convolutional layer, and doubling the number of nodes in the hidden layer all yielded promising results, with accurcy scores above `0.95`.
